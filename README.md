## About The Github Workflow

Our workflow in github for modular, progressive approach and readiness for the future huge project. The early we start, the better. In this section, you'll learn about the basics and foundation of getting used to `git` commands. There are a few we need to learn, others will come along the way.

## How to start a github project

To start a project, you can simply create a sample files you want to push on Github. Once that is done, create a repository in Github and just follow their instructions for your first push. 

## Continous deployment

You'll learn two types of levels you need to keep in mind, one for basic projects and another for enterprise project. 

### Basic project:
* git add .
* git commit -m "first commit"
* git push

If you encountered any problems during push, simply read the instructions provided. In any ways, that's the start of learning.

### Advanced projects:

Straightforward push is not ideal like you used in basic projects. You have to be open minded to all scenarios you might encounter in the future. Problems, bugs, features, enhancements, and others. You have to think as wide as you can to keep track to any updates of your application. History is very important.

1. Commit all changes:
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "_what you're working on_"`

First, always commit your changes.

2. Make sure you have the latest files from `main` branch
* `git checkout -b feature/name`

Make sure everytime you want to push something, create a branch of your own always. Don't just push in your `main` or `master` branch. And avoid hard editions or direct commits in your repo. E.g., adding files in `main` branch, add 1 line of code.

* `git checkout main` 
* `git pull`
* `git add .`
* `git commmit -m "_commit_"`

Why pull main and commit changes from main? This is required to make sure you're ahead from `main` branch. 

3). Merge your branch to main

* git merge main _yourbranch_

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
