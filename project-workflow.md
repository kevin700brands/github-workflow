# Project Workflow

This section states my workflow for fast and effective output. 

## Mockup

First stage will be crucial, I will be building the mockup but before I start, I have to:

* Ask questions to the designer, if have <br/>
* Clarify some functionalities <br/>
* Make sure everything is clear because everyone is occupied <br/>
* Provide an ETA or achieve the given ETA <br/>

Build the mockup without <b>effects</b>, <b>tests</b>, or others <b>unrelated</b> to the project, the way it looks should be presented without question.

## Turn around Time

Once the mock up is done, finalize the ETA or if given. This section will be simple but crucial, turn around time must be quick and efficient. 

* Decide about the tool <br/>
* Make sure everything is scalable and is not fragile <br/>
* Doesn't need to be hasty if quality will be sacrificed <br/>

## Quality

Lastly, the quality, make sure everything are in place.  

* Responsiveness to all devices especially in Apple
* WYSWYG based on PSD.
* Completely functional based on expected results

## Revisions

<b>This will be the output</b>, before it should be submitted, the things needed/necessary for the `first revision` must be in the page. The effects, and the latter will be in the 2nd revision. 3rd revision will be the final in normal cases.

* Submitting a revision must be finalize first and stagely listed in ASANA for future reference
* No previous changes should pop up



## Conclusion

This is a good information and standard before doing things.
