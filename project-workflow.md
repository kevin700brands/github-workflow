# Project Workflow

This section states my workflow for fast and effective output. 

## Mockup

First stage will be crucial, I will be building the mockup but before I start, I have to:

1). Ask questions to the designer, if have
2). Clarify some functionalities
3). Make sure everything is clear because everyone is occupied
4). Provide an ETA or achieve the given ETA

<b>Build the mockup without effects, tests, or others unrelated to the project, the way it looks should be presented without question. </b>

## Turn around Time

Once the mock up is done, finalize the ETA or if given. This section will be simple but crucial, turn around time must be quick and efficient. 

1). Decide about the tool
2). Make sure everything is scalable and is not fragile
3). Doesn't need to be hasty if quality will be sacrificed

## Quality

Lastly, the quality, make sure everything are in place. No need to be so haste
