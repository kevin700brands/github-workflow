# Development Workflow

## React

In React framework, this is used to manage the site and neatly structure things needed to run in old and modern browsers. They have also have a lot of support, community is great, and issues are properly addressed that is why I trust them over others. Building it in vanilla may take years and years until you'll finaly reach the latter level supposed to be tangible & achievable in short period of time. Medieval approach is not recommended in this stage of fast evolvement of technologies, Don't re-invent the wheel, use it and surge all benefits you can get.

## Scaleable and Maintainable

Making things scaleable will be crucial to all projects to lessen usage time in the future. Features, bugs, enhancements, and others will be properly addressed if this can be done. React will be the start.


## Tests

To gain confidence, its crucial to perform tests to the application to easily manage in years to come. It can also serve as bridge for other developers to see what's happening under the hood. It's highly proven that it can track bugs as soon as it occurs. However, this is only good for enterprise projects but its recommended to perform tests.

* Jest
* React-Testing Library
* Airbnb

## Libraries

Make sure to use a library that has a intellectual developers that can support you along the way if bug issues occurred <b>not</b> that's it. Properly investigate what's happening under the hood and the last update has made. Anytime it can be deprecated and archived. Be careful for 1-2 years from now `back to zero revision`. Plan everything possible to keep your application to breath for years to come.

* Autoprefixer, optimizer, and the rest of the things needed for optimization. 

## Real-Time Browser Testing

The application must be confidently serve in IOS apps and could cover most of the browsers in the web. Build up confidence by doing automation tests but it can cost a lot of resources.

## Conclusion

This will be a good way of talking to the application, properly plan will lead to more success and less failures.
