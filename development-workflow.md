In React framework, this is used to manage the site and neatly structure things needed to run in old and modern browsers. They have also have a lot of support, community is great, and issues are properly addressed that is why I trust them over others. Building it in vanilla may take years and years until you'll finaly reach the latter level supposed to be tangible & achievable in short time. Don't re-invent the wheel, use it and surge all benefits you can get.

* Prepare the environment will be using, autoprefixer, optimizer, and the rest of the things needed for optimization. 
* Decide the tools you'll be using before starting if possible
